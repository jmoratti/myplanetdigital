<h3 id="more-than-lofty-promises">More Than Lofty Promises</h3>
<p>B Corporations are companies that voluntarily meet higher standards of transparency, accountability, and performance (as evaluated by the nonprofit B Lab). B Corporations believe that they can do well by doing good, benefiting society while demonstrating strong financial performance.</p>
<p>Certified B Corporations are rated on four Impact Areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Governance - Our mission, stakeholder engagement, and overall transparency of practices and policies.</li>
<li>Workers - Our relationship with our team. Assesses compensation, quality of work environment, communication, and culture.</li>
<li>Community - Our impact on our community. Includes supplier relations, diversity, and community involvement.</li>
<li>Environment - Our commitment to environmental best practices. Includes facilities, energy/materials use, and emissions.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h3>
<p>While attaining Certified B Corporation status means we&#39;ve committed to a higher standard than most, we believe this is just the beginning. Achieving 93/200 possible points means we have a long way to go to be the shining example we know we can be, but having an objective third-party measure of our progress means we know where we need to improve.</p>
<p>We hope to report back frequently on our progress as we continue to develop our company as a positive, contributing member of our community and society. Your suggestions and feedback are welcome!</p>
